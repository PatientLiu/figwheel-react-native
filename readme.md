## Figwheel React Native Hot Reloading (with Reagent)
#### Instructions

1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/decker405/figwheel-react-native.git`
2. `cd figwheel-react-native`
3. Install node dependencies: `npm i`
4. `cd rn-test`
5. Run figwheel: `lein figwheel` or `rlwrap lein figwheel` (if rlwrap installed)
6. `cd ../`
7. Run packager: `npm start` or `./node_modules/react-native/packager/packager.sh`
8. Open `ios/figTest.xcodeproj` in XCode
9. Run app in simulator
10. Press `âŒ˜ + D `  and select `Debug in Chrome`
11. Watch figwheel dependencies load and then connect
12. Make changes to your code or in the repl

I also advise you to install watchman `brew install watchman` (it will make the packager faster)
[watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)

#### Notes

- This is very experimental (should work with RN 0.12.0 and below, but haven't tested it)
- Only tested with iOS
- Live-reload works
- There may be errors when adding or removing files that will require you to reload the simulator
- I expect uncaught errors in edge-cases (the code is not incredibly robust)

#### TODO:
- ~~Automatically remove react.inc.js from dependencies (when reagent or om is required)~~
- Write a plugin for lein-figwheel instead of shimming goog.net.jsLoader.load
- Test on RN 0.13.0-RC
- Production app build step
- Test on actual iOS device (not simulator)
- Remove @providesModule from figwheel_bridge.js and put in npm?
- Deal with the `*.js.map?rel=####` error (packager not accepting queries that don't involve platform=ios/android) - not sure if this is a major problem or not...
- lein build template

### How it works:
- React Native's `Debug in Chrome` option opens up a web socket with the simulator/device, executes all javascript code in a web worker, and then sends the results to device (or something of the sort, not sure I fully understand)
- Shimming goog.require and goog.net.jsLoader (figwheel uses jsLoader to reload files) to use the webworkers `importScripts()` function allows Google Closure to work without `<script>`s
